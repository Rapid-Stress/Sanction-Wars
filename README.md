# Sanction-Wars
**A small java game project

This is a small 2D pixel-art slit-controller multiplayer(hopfully) singleplayer(campaign/AI Battle) fighting game.
Inspired by Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Shadow Fight 2 (android)

We are two students and aspiring game devs. So take any of the code we post with a grain of salt, TL;DR The code will be bad or atleast not optimal (for now).
I'm based in West Bengal, India. This is my third [itch.io](https://itch.io) game. Here are my [other games](https://verzaii-studios.itch.io/) if you want to give them a shot.

Currently, I'm working with my one of my friends (game design, story, direction) and I'm working on (programming, art, some story)
